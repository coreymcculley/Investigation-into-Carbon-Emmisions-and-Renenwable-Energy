## Project Description

This project is a global comparison of capital inflows and investment into renewable energy production and its consumption. Energy use will be compared to economic indicators (such as GDP, GDP per capita, PPP by country) as well as how investment compares to carbon emissions by country. 

## Research Questions 

1.	What are the top 5 countries that have the highest percentage use of renewable energy by their power consumption annually? 
2.	Who are the 5 largest producers of carbon emissions annually? 
3.	How does the US vs EU+UK vs China compare in investment into renewables? 
4.	How does the past decade of investment compare to subsequent reduction in emissions? 
5.	How does the past decade of investment relate to the countries GDP per capita? 
6.	Is there a correlation in the price of West Texas Intermediate Crude (WTI) and the investment in renewable energy?
